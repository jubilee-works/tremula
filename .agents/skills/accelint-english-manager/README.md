# accelint-english-manager

Rewrite English so it is clearer, plainer, easier to scan, and easier to act on without changing the user's meaning.

This skill is part of the `gohypergiant/agent-skills` repository. Install it through the repo-wide skills flow, not as a standalone npm package.

## Installation

Install the skill collection, then select `accelint-english-manager` when the CLI prompts you.

**npm:**
```bash
npx skills add gohypergiant/agent-skills
```

**pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm dlx skills add gohypergiant/agent-skills
```

This skill does not ship as a separate package with its own `package.json`.

## Quick Start

This skill works best when you tell it both the job and the mode.

```text
/accelint-english-manager audit+rewrite in strict mode the following:

"
This page is intended to provide users with a helpful overview of how project access works. In most cases, people will be able to request access through the admin panel, although there are some exceptions for legacy environments.
"
```

That prompt shape is already used elsewhere in this repo when another skill needs a final prose-polish pass.

## What is accelint-english-manager?

`accelint-english-manager` is an editorial skill for rewriting English without drifting meaning, tone, audience, or required constraints. It is built for docs, prompts, support replies, release notes, UI copy, policy text, and other writing where clarity matters more than flourish.

The skill combines plain-language discipline, STE-leaning structure, and ADHD-friendly shaping. It uses those together rather than treating them as separate modes.

## Why use it?

A lot of editing tools make text shorter but less accurate. Others flatten the voice so much that the result sounds robotic.

This skill is meant to avoid both problems.

- It preserves meaning before it optimizes wording.
- It keeps exact technical text, commands, identifiers, and file paths intact unless the user asks to rewrite them.
- It separates rewrite scope with `mode=default` and `mode=strict`.
- It supports audit-only, rewrite-only, and audit-plus-rewrite work.
- It explicitly avoids claiming official ASD-STE100 compliance.

Use it when you want cleaner writing that still does the same job. If you need subject-matter review, legal review, or formal standards certification, this skill is not a substitute for those.

## API

This skill is content-first. Its public surface is the skill folder and the behavior-bearing files inside it.

### `SKILL.md`

The canonical instructions for when to use the skill, how to choose rewrite mode and output mode, how to preserve constraints, and how to structure the final response.

Key concepts documented there include:

- rewrite modes: `mode=default`, `mode=strict`
- output modes: `audit only`, `rewrite only`, `audit plus rewrite`
- hard constraints that outrank style preferences
- reference-loading guidance
- required self-checks before delivery

### `references/substitutions.md`

Wording cleanup guidance for filler removal, consistency sets, and modality checks.

### `references/checklist.md`

A final verification pass for meaning preservation, stable terminology, modality, exact technical text, and output-mode compliance.

### `references/ste-rules.md`

The reference for strict STE-leaning or highly controlled technical rewrites.

Use this when the request is procedural, technical, instructional, or explicitly asks for STE-style review. The skill does not claim official ASD-STE100 compliance.

### `references/adhd-patterns.md`

Patterns for stronger action-oriented shaping when the reader needs clearer execution help or lower-friction next steps.

### `references/use-cases.md`

Guidance for adapting the skill to different artifact types such as docs, prompts, support replies, incident notes, UI copy, and voice-sensitive writing.

### `references/rfc-2119.md`

Guidance for normalizing informal severity labels in normative or behavior-defining text when clearer obligation wording helps.

### `references/examples.md`

Worked examples that show how the skill handles audits, rewrites, voice-sensitive text, procedural wording, and scope control.

### `CHANGELOG.md`

Version history for the skill. This repo uses file-driven versioning for skills, so `CHANGELOG.md` and `metadata.version` in `SKILL.md` should stay aligned.

### `evals/evals.json`

Evaluation prompts for the skill. These are most useful to maintainers, but they also provide the best real request examples in this folder.

## Examples

These examples come from real files in this repo. They are better than made-up prompts because they reflect how this skill is actually exercised.

### Audit plus rewrite

Source: `skills/accelint-english-manager/evals/evals.json`

```text
Audit this paragraph and list the highest-risk issues first, then give a rewrite: 'We have identified an issue that may have impacted some users during the deployment window, and engineering is currently working to remediate the situation as quickly as possible.'
```

Use this when you want both findings and a revised version.

### Rewrite-only release note cleanup

Source: `skills/accelint-english-manager/evals/evals.json`

```text
Tighten this release note entry without changing scope or adding hype: 'This update includes improvements to export reliability and reduces the number of cases where scheduled reports fail when a data source responds slowly.' Return only the revised release note in final output.
```

Use this when you want a cleaner final version with no audit commentary.

### Error-help rewrite with exact technical text preserved

Source: `skills/accelint-english-manager/evals/evals.json`

```text
Rewrite this error help text so it is clearer and easier to act on, but keep the command and filename exact: 'The config loader was unable to parse settings.json. Please check the file for trailing commas and then rerun sync --apply.' Return only the revised text in final output.
```

Use this when commands, filenames, or other technical text must stay exact.

### Strict prose-polish pass

Source: `skills/accelint-readme-writer/SKILL.md`

```text
/accelint-english-manager audit+rewrite in strict mode the following:

"
[PASTE CONTENT HERE]
"

I do not want a report, just apply the new content to the output directly.
```

Use this when another workflow needs a final cleanup pass with tighter control.
